			<h2>Problem Space</h2>
			<p class="text">
			Apex Benefits, a health benefits company, was launching a new web-based product to help medium to large sized companies manage 
			and track their complex benefits needs, promote a healthy work environment with in-office clinics and wellness programs. After 
			developing their new product, they needed a marketing campaign to launch the product to the public.
			</p>
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p class="text">
			Since the product was going to be internet-based, it seemed natural to market the product through internet-based channels. We 
			created a flash-based microsite that illustrated the Health-e-Trac process and how it may fit within an organization's HR 
			department and describes what their product offers. In order to create a unique visual impact in our marketing efforts we utilized 
			a hand-drawn style and used actual high-definition video to create a more organic feel. Since the ultimate goal of the microsite 
			was to capture visitor's contact information for further sales efforts, this website was also designed to fit within a larger 
			context of online banner ads and print ads. Our efforts resulted in an increased awareness of the product.
