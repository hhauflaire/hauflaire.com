			<p>This theme is a child theme for Modularity, a multimedia theme framework for Wordpress.  The theme design was developed with users who appreciate visual browsing and prefer a minimal layout, with their photos and multimedia featured front and center.  But, the theme can been used to create everything from e-commerce sites, music review sites, portfolio sites, and everything in between.  Homepage designs can be turned on and off at the click of a button on the Theme Options panel.  <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GraphPaperPress">Subscribe to Graph Paper Press' feed</a> or follow us on the bleeding edge of development by <a href="http://twitter.com/GraphPaperPress">following us on Twitter</a>.</p>

			<h3>Best Practices</h3>
				<p>If you want to make changes to how this theme looks and feels, than create a child theme.  Never make changes to the original theme files.  Why?  Because when a new version of this theme is released, all of your changes will be lost when you update.  Plus, making a child theme is incredibly easy.  <a href="http://op111.net/p53">Here is how you do it.</a></p>

		<li class="box">
			<h3>Installation</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Unzip the folder contained in the archive to your computer</li>
						<li>Upload the folder and its contents to the themes directory of your blog, located in &quot;wp-content/themes&quot; where WordPress is installed.</li>
						<li>Click on Appearance - Themes menu from the WP admin panel, then select the theme to activate.</li>
					  <li>Click on View Site at the top of the page.  Bam.  Hot site!</li>
					</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Initial setup</h3>
			<p>This theme is a 950px wide, one or two column theme, depending on options you have chosen.  We need to set up your default image and thumbnail sizes to allow for easy posting and consistent design structure.  Click <strong>Settings - Media</strong> and <strong>set your thumbnail size</strong> to <strong>310px wide by 150px tall</strong>. Set your <strong>medium size</strong> images to <strong>590px wide.  Do not set the height</strong>.  Set your <strong>large size</strong> images to <strong>950px wide.  Do not set the height</strong>.  Post thumbnails are generated automatically by the functions contained in this theme.  By default, the theme pulls in the <strong>latest image</strong> uploaded to the post.  There is no need to use custom fields for adding post thumbnails.  Simply upload your images using Wordpress' new Add Media button, write a caption and description and click save.  While the theme will pull in the thumbnail automatically, it will not add the medium or large sized image to your post automatically.  For that, just click the insert image button just as you normally would.  If you need additional instructions on uploading photos, inserting photo galleries and using the Wordpress interface, please view this <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">screencast</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Media settings</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>In Wordpress, click on Media Settings.  Set your thumbnails to 310 x 150.  Set your medium photo size to 590.  Set your large size to 950.</li>
			<li>This theme will automatically create thumbnails from the images that you upload.  By default, the thumbnail size is 150 x 150.  This can be easily changed, if you know a little bit of CSS.</li>
			<li>If you plan on self-hosting your own video to use the theme's built-in HD video player, you need to use the Post Thumbnail text field on the Write Post panel and paste the URL to your video thumbnail.  The dimensions of the thumbnail should exactly match the dimensions of the video dimensions that you plug into the Post Video Options panel.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Theme Options</h3>
			<p>This theme has seven optional homepage designs:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Slideshow Section - A full page slideshow</li>
					<li>HD Video Section - A full page video presentation</li>
					<li>Featured Sliding Posts - A horizontal slider that reveals six featured posts</li>
					<li>Thumbnail Slider - A horizontal list of thumbnails representing recent posts</li>
					<li>Featured Section - A main post at left, with three earlier posts at right</li>
					<li>Blog Section- A normal tubular list of posts</li>
					<li>Categories Section - A five column grid of selected categories</li>
				</ol>
				<br/>
			<p>Please activate each option and view your new homepage design.  Remember, less is more.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<p>The navigation contains a listing of all your pages and posts, your contact info and the search bar. You can set or remove the contact info from the Theme Options panel.  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_pages"> For further reading, please see these instructions.</a></p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Video</h3>
			<p>Modularity has a built-in HD video player that plays FLV video files.  You are no longer restricted to pixelated YouTube videos.  To add a video, upload the FLV file to your server using your favorite method, like FTP.  Copy and paste the link to the file into a custom field called <strong>video</strong>.  Next, add a video thumbnail.  You can do this the exact way that you add regular thumbnails, except, you will want to add an image large enough to fit the maximum size of the video player, for best results try an image that is 950px wide.  Add the video thumbnail to a custom field with key value <strong>video-thumb</strong>.  For <strong>multiple videos</strong> within a post or page, try different values for the same <strong>video</strong> key which mean you can have 2 or more instances of <strong>video</strong> key. Same goes for <strong>video-thumb</strong>. Note that each thumbnail should be in the same precedence as that of video for them to match. You can also add other multimedia, which can include virtually any media with embed capabilities.  Enter "multimedia" as the key value and paste your YouTube, Vimeo, or any other html embed code into the value field.  You can read more about using custom fields <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2007/10/24/using-wordpress-custom-fields-introduction">here.</a></p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Thumbnails</h3>
			<p>By default, thumbnails are auto cropped by Wordpress.  This theme checks first to see if you have added the URL to your prefered thumbnail to custom field called, you guessed it, thumbnail.  If not, the theme will defer to the first photo that you uploaded using Wordpress' Add Photo icon.  If you haven't uploaded a photo using the Add Photo icon, the theme will can the post body for an image, and use it.  If no photo exists in the post body, the theme will use a default image.  As you can see, this series of "checks" allow you to have 100% control over your post thumnbnails.  If you want to add cropping functionlity to your Wordpress site, please <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/scissors/">download and install the Sissors plugin.</a></p>
			</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Widgets</h3>
					<p>There are a total of three widgetized areas on this theme, depending on which options you activate on the Theme Options panel.  Three widgetized areas appear on the bottom and there is one sidebar widget. You can add and delete widgets by clicking Design - Widgets, from within your Wordpress admin panel.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Advertising</h3>
			<p>This theme has two built-in spots for advertising:  One in the sidebar, which measures 310 pixels wide, and one underneath the main post, which measures 590 pixels wide.  You can add your adversing code on the Theme Options panel.</p>
		</li>
		<li class="box">
			<h3>Common problems</h3>
			<p>This theme uses jQuery javascript to do lots of fancy stuff.  If your theme looks broken, than you likely have a plugin that uses a conflicting javascript library.  Deactivate your plugins, one-by-one, to determine which plugin is conflicting with jQuery.</p>
