			<p>The new 42,000 square foot addition to the existing John H. Boner Community Center building will allow the center to more easily meet the needs of their clients by providing many services under one roof.

The existing Brookside building (Right) was renovated to expand the Seniors' Center and Elder Care Program. Also, the second floor efficiency apartments were expanded and renovated. The addition provides classrooms and a Multi-Purpose Room for program functions as well as utilization by the community. Not only will this dramatically improve their service coverage, but it will serve as a cornerstone of redevelopment within the community.</p>
